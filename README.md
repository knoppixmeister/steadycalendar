This project containers the source code for a full, end to end Flutter example as part of a new course on [fluttercrashcourse.com](https://fluttercrashcourse.com). 

We will _fully_ develop this app along with a backend, using [supabase.io](https://supabase.io), Google Cloud Platform and submit it to the Apple and Android app store.

Course notes are [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Nd3Zi87P94Uj8uqIz_egMAWj2gKFgw5bQiRrd5g4evw/edit?usp=sharing) on Google Docs. They are a wip and will be built out as we go.
